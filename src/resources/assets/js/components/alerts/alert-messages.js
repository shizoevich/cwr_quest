export const ProviderAvailabilityMessage = `<p>This feature of system is currently being tested and scheduled to go live next month. At this time, this part of the system is not being used to assign new patients. Please feel free to view and test how it works if interested. Everyone will be informed in advance and trained how to use this new "provider availability and new patient assignment" feature. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
ATTENTION! In order to get new patients referred, you must submit your availability schedule for next week. CWR Admin will use availability information provided by you to schedule only the 1st appointment with all new patients assigned to you. All future appointments will be handled by you through OfficeAlly as usual. Your name will not be shown on the list of providers available until you submit your availability schedule, therefore, no new patients will be referred to you by CWR Admin.
